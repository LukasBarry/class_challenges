#Intro to JavaScript

##Agenda 

This class is an intro to JavaScript. We will using the concepts we've learned from Ruby to enhance your understanding of JS. By the end of this class you should be familiar with the following. 

- JavaScript History
- What is JS?
- Fuctional vs Object Oriented
- Fundamental JS
- JS in the Browser
- DOM manipulation

Learning these skills is imperative to building fully functional Applications with Rails. And while this intro is not comprehensive, you will be equipped with basic knowledge to accomplish your goals and continue your path of learning. 



##History and Overview

- 1995 Netscape wanted to add scripting to web pages
- Brandon Eich wrote the first version in 10 days
- **JavaScript is not Java**
- JS is not Object Oriented... it is functional

## The JS Console

Because JS works in the browser, you can use the `console` in your DevTools as a `REPL` (think IRB).

You can open the JS Console by typing `cmd` +  `option` + `j`

Here you can: 

- test and log output from your pgogram
- scratch out ideas and concepts
- test out those new ideas
- interact with JavaScript variables, objects, etc. that have loaded with the page.

**Make it interactive:**

- console.log
- alert
- prompt
- confirm




## Variables

variable declarations are similar to Ruby, with the exception that you prepend the `var` keyword and end your declaration with a `;`

```javascript
var x = 1;
var y = "2";
var z = true;
```
